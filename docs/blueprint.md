# **App Name**: MediView Admin

## Core Features:

- Interactive User Table: Displays user data in a clear, editable table format.  Includes columns for username, first/last name, email, department, MFA Policy, and Identity Mapping.
- User Selection and Hover: Allows single or multi-selection of users via checkboxes to enable bulk actions. Implements row hover and cell click effects.
- In-Line Editing: Enables editing cell content directly within the table. Clicking a cell transforms it into an input field, saving the changes when focus is lost.
- User Management Actions: Includes options for adding new users and performing bulk actions like remove, or batch updates for MFA policy or department assignments.
- AI Security Recommendations: The application uses a tool to offer recommendations for enhancing system security. Although simulated, it gives specific, actionable advice to improve security.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a monochromatic color scheme with light grays and whites for the table background and cells to maintain a minimalist look.
- Incorporate a very light accent color (e.g., pale blue #E3F2FD) on hover for table cells to indicate interactivity.
- Employ a stronger accent color (e.g. blue #2196F3) for primary actions like 'Add User' and to highlight interactive elements.
- Use a clean, sans-serif typeface (e.g., system font) for all text elements to ensure readability.
- Ensure table has clear horizontal and vertical borders. Borders should be a light shade of gray (e.g. #D3D3D3) to provide structure without visual clutter.
- Use simple, consistent icons for actions. Icons should be a single color, matching the accent color, and minimalistic.
